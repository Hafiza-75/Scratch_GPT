⚠️ Important Note:
The PenguinGPT extension may no longer be available on Scratch.
Without it, only the basic hardcoded chatbot works.

ScratchGPT - Chatbot in Scratch 🤖
(Supports PenguinGPT Extension if Available)

📌 About This Project:
This is a beginner-friendly chatbot simulation created using Scratch.
It works in two modes depending on the availability of the PenguinGPT extension:

🟢 Mode 1: With PenguinGPT Extension (If Available)
Ask any question, get real AI-style answers powered by PenguinGPT.

Works like a mini ChatGPT right inside Scratch.

🔧 Example Logic with PenguinGPT:
🗨️ ask [Type your question:] and wait
🗨️ penguinGPT ask (answer) and wait
🗨️ say (penguinGPT response)

🔵 Mode 2: Without PenguinGPT (Manual Chatbot)
Uses simple if-else blocks to respond to fixed questions.

For anything else, shows a default reply.

💡 Example Hardcoded Chatbot:
🗨️ ask [Type your question:] and wait

If answer = "hello" ➡️ say "Hi there! I'm ScratchGPT. How can I assist you?"  
If answer = "how are you" ➡️ say "I'm just a bunch of code, but I'm feeling smart today!"  
If answer = "what's your name" ➡️ say "I'm ScratchGPT — your chatbot made in Scratch!"  
If answer = "what is scratch" or "who made you" ➡️ say "I was made by a smart Scratch programmer like you!"  
Else ➡️ say "Sorry, I don't understand."  
🚀 How to Use:
✅ Add PenguinGPT extension (if available) for full AI responses.
✅ Without the extension, enjoy basic chatbot replies using Scratch blocks.
✅ You can expand the chatbot by adding more if-else conditions for extra questions.
